# Whitelist

## OVERVIEW

The **whitelist** option on all Minefort servers is great to keep your server safe. You can make it so only specific users can join the server, or none at all.

## EXPLAINED

* To enable the whitelist, run `/whitelist on`.
* To disable the whitelist, run `/whitelist off`.
* To add players to the whitelist, run `/whitelist add (player)`.
* To remove players from the whitelist, run `/whitelist remove (player)`.
